## Important
* WhatsApp Business released API on May 2022, no longer needed this repository. You can accomplish your same requirements through WhatsApp Business APIs.

## Prerequisites

In order to run the python script, your system must have the following programs/packages installed and the contact number should be saved in your phone (You can use bulk contact number saving procedure of email). There is a way without saving the contact number but has the limitation to send the attachment.
* Python 3.8: Download it from https://www.python.org/downloads
* Selenium Web Driver: Either you can use repo driver else you can download it https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
* Google Chrome : Download it from https://www.google.com/chrome
* Pandas : Run in command prompt **pip install pandas**
* Xlrd : Run in command prompt **pip install xlrd**
* Selenium: Run in command prompt **pip install selenium** 

## Approach
* User scans web QR code to log in into the WhatsApp web application.
* The script reads a customized message from excel sheet.
* The script reads rows one by one and searches that contact number in the web search box if the contact number found on WhatsApp then it will send a configured message otherwise It reads next row. 
* Loop execute until and unless all rows complete.

Note: If you wish to send an image instead of text you can write attachment selection python code.
